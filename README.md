# Sentiment Analysis Neural Network: Domain Adaptation from Snappfood to Digikala

This project explores sentiment analysis using neural networks, focusing on domain adaptation between two Persian websites: **Snappfood**, a food delivery platform, and **Digikala**, a comprehensive e-commerce platform. The notebook leverages deep learning to train a model on one domain and fine-tune it for another, addressing challenges such as domain shifts.

## Features
- **Training a Sentiment Analyzer**: Trains a model using comments from Snappfood.
- **Domain Adaptation**: Fine-tunes the trained model using comments from Digikala.
- **Handling Domain Shifts**: Demonstrates techniques to handle discrepancies between datasets from two domains.

## Project Objectives
1. Understand and overcome domain shifts in sentiment analysis tasks.
2. Apply fine-tuning strategies to enhance model performance in a different domain.
3. Gain insights into Persian text processing for sentiment analysis.
